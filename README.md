Content-Based Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a content-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and the content of the movies themselves. By analyzing movie attributes like genre,title, original_langauage, popularity and potentially plot descriptions (depending on your implementation), the system identifies similar movies and recommends them.

Implementation Details

Data Preprocessing: Describe how you clean and prepare the movie data (e.g., handling missing values, converting categorical data).
Feature Engineering: Explain any feature extraction or transformation techniques used to represent movies for similarity calculations (e.g., TF-IDF for plot descriptions, one-hot encoding for categorical features).
Similarity Measure: Specify the similarity metric used to compare movies (e.g., cosine similarity, Euclidean distance).
Recommendation Algorithm: Explain the process of finding similar movies based on user preferences or a reference movie (e.g., neighborhood-based approach, matrix factorization).
Evaluation: (Optional) If applicable, describe any evaluation metrics used to assess the recommendation system's performance (e.g., precision, recall, recommendation accuracy).
